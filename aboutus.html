                <p>As Film Geek's hosts, we are three passionate movie fans who are excited to share our enthusiasm for
                    TV
                    shows
                    and films to everyone. This podcast, where we discuss the best TV shows and films recommendations,
                    came
                    up from
                    our constant talks about the newest films and our favorite series. Although our backgrounds may be
                    different Our
                    shared passion of storytelling connects us, even if one of us is a huge fan of anime and the other
                    is
                    addicted
                    to blockbusters and binge worthy tv shows.</p>

                <p> We provide plenty of opinions, from in depth research to lighthearted, funny conversations. We are
                    aware
                    of
                    the
                    overwhelming nature of selecting the ideal movie or TV show, especially when our emotion is a major
                    factor.
                    This
                    podcast was created with the intention of supporting you on your path by offering sincere, targeted
                    guidance
